## Project title
Building a functioning calculator through JS and DOM. Part of DigitalCrafts curriculum.

## Decription
We were given instructions:

https://gist.github.com/seanrreid/bcc0f5a97e10a551232e758b7ef2fa96

And put into groups. Not includded in the instructions were any CSS enhancements to make it look like a real calculator, so we spent extra time doing that before moving on to the JS functionality, which was more of a class-group project. 

## Build status
Might add more funcionality at another time.

## Code style
HTML, CSS, JS

## Tests
Various console logs to test in the dom that our arrays were doing what we needed, various iteration and order of operation tests.
